# Image processing techniques for segmentation and localization of cells from videos

The aim of this final degree project is to study the feasibility of using deep learning techniques to identify individual cells in cell culture videos. This is a necessary preliminary step in order to then evaluate cell tracking using algorithms designed for this purpose, identifying the behaviour of cancer cells in relation to normal cells based on the way they move.

Once the coordinates of the cells in the videos have been provided, parameters that allow their movement to be characterised and quantified, such as speed distribution, the existence of coordinated movements, turns, etc., would be calculated and analysed. These descriptors can feed into machine learning algorithms, including deep learning, to classify the type of movement, for example, between cancerous or normal, and can even determine qualitative differences with potential biomedical relevance, such as making a more personalised diagnosis of cancer and determining a more individualised treatment for each patient.
